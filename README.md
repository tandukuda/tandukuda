# Hi, I'm Ridho 👋

I'm a **self-taught programmer** with no formal background in IT or computer science — just a lot of curiosity, late nights, and a stubborn drive to figure things out.

By day, I'm a **3D artist and graphic designer** creating visual content under the name **tandukuda** — working with music labels, brands, and creative studios to turn ideas into imagery. By night (or whenever I get the chance), I dive into code and build tools to make creative work easier and more fun.

### ✨ What I do:
- 🎨 3D design & motion graphics  
- 🧠 Creative direction & visual storytelling  
- 🛠️ Frontend development & creative tooling  
- 💻 Learning by building (and breaking) things

### 🧪 Currently working on:
- **Skatchr** – an open-source web whiteboard for sketching and collaboration  
- Customizing my Linux workflow with **Hyprland**  
- Creating design mockups, experimental tools, and digital assets

### 🧰 Tools I like:
`React` • `TailwindCSS` • `Next.js` • `Three.js` • `Svelte` • `Hyprland` • `Blender` • `Figma` • `Affinity Designer`

### 🧭 My approach:
No degrees, no bootcamps — just a self-taught path blending design and code. I'm all about **learning in public**, **making things that scratch my own itch**, and building from a place of curiosity and creativity.
